            This page should check the changes that user done and do the necessary work to save those changes. <br />
            This page should redirect the user to view profile page after saving the changes. <br />
            <br />
            Most likely the user will not see this page and instead he will see that the changes has saved or something <br />
            like that. <br />
            Dynamic page based on the user type. <br />
