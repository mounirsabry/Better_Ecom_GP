        <p>
            This is the logout page. <br />
            This page should redirect the user to the coresponding suitable page. <br />
            The student/instructor should go to the student/instructor login page. <br />
            The admin should go to the admin login page. <br />
            <br />
            Try to make the page behaviour dynamic so that the page redirect the user based on his type instead of <br />
            making three pages. <br />
